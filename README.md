Some of the minor ML projects I was working on during my machine learning masterclass training and while taking some online courses. 

**Ecommerce:** Using regression models to see whether it pays off more to invest into web sale or mobile app marketing. 

**Tax:** Using kNN algorithm to predict taxes for various companies based in Serbia.

**Mercury:** Using a regression algorithm to interpolate missing values in a dataset noting the concentration variations of a mercury
contained in a water.
