Some of the minor ML projects I was working on during my machine learning masterclass training and while taking some online courses.

**Car Sales:** Using artificial neural networ to precisely predict car prices. 

**Spam or Ham NLP:** Uisng a natural language processing techniques and training the Multinomial Naive Bayes classificator on a set of emails, we build a model which tries to predict whether a given email is a spam or a regular message (ham).

**Predicting Google Stock Price Trends with RNN:** Training a recurrent neural network with long-short term memory cells architecture to predict the behaviour of the Google stock prices over time. 

**Ecommerce:** Using regression models to see whether it pays off more to invest into web sale or mobile app marketing. 

**Tax:** Using kNN algorithm to predict taxes for various companies based in Serbia.

**Mercury:** Using a regression algorithm to interpolate missing values in a dataset noting the concentration variations of a mercury
contained in a water.
